                  <h1> Honda City Car </h1>
                  <h3>Description:-<br>
                    <h4>Top Speep:-</h4> 195 Kmph<br></h5>
                    <h4>Avg:-</h4> 18-24 km/l combined</h5>
                    <h4>Noise:-</h4> Clunking Noise from the Alternator Belt<br>
                        The noise is very prominent in petrol <br>models of the Honda City where users <br>
                        have reported hearing metal <br>screeching noise when cruising <br>or at a standstill.This issue <br>eventually comes down a <br>faulty alternator belt.</h5>
                    <h4>Comfort & Luxury:-</h4> 
                    Yes. You will enjoy a nice<br>
                    relaxed cruise in the new Honda City.<br>
                    Both engines are at ease on the highway,<br>
                    and are efficient too. Absolutely comfortable,<br>
                    you can drive 12 hours continuously without<br>
                    any fatigue thereafter.<br>

                  <h1> Honda Amaze Car </h1>
                  <h3>Description:-<br>
                    <h4>Top Speep:-</h4> 160 Kmph<br></h5>
                    <h4>Avg:-</h4> 18-25 km/l combined</h5>
                    <h4>Noise:-</h4> 
                    The engine noise is high <br>
                    and I did not like the <br>
                    non-linear acceleration of the car.<br>
                    As soon as I touched 80-85 kmph,<br>
                    the common problem with CVT<br>started to occur.
                    Will be a much<br>better decision to go for manual<br>
                    variant if you hit highways<br>
                    regularly and don't like other<br>
                    cars overtaking you much.
                    <h4>Comfort & Luxury:-</h4> 
                    The Amaze is pretty<br>
                    comfortable for long rides.<br>
                    The suspension can soak up<br>
                    all the bumps on the way it<br>
                    makes the car very comfortable. <br>
                    You get good sound insulation in the car.<br>
                    The rear passengers have a lot of knee room<br>
                     as well as leg-room on offer.

                  <h1> Honda Jazz Car </h1>
                  <h3>Description:-<br>
                    <h4>Top Speep:-</h4> 172 Kmph<br>
                    <h4>Avg:-</h4> 17 km/l combined<br>
                    <h4>Noise:-</h4> 
                    The engine noise is high <br>
                    and I Diesel engines make <br>
                    a lot of noise while burning the<br>
                    fuel. The main reason behind this is <br>
                    that diesel molecules are much bigger <br>
                    than petrol molecules and the engines <br>
                    run on high compression. Another <br>prominent reason behind the excessive <br>noise in diesel engines
                    is the fact that <br>
                    diesel engines do not use spark ignition.
                    <h4>Comfort & Luxury:-</h4> 
                    Best car ever. I can't rate my Honda Jazz<br>
                    highly enough. <br>
                    And for a car of its size,<br>
                    it's really very comfortable.

                    <h1> Honda Brio Car </h1>
                    <h3>Description:-<br>
                      <h4>Top Speep:-</h4> 	145 Kmph<br>
                      <h4>Avg:-</h4> 16.5 kmpl combined<br>
                      <h4>Noise:-</h4> 
                        Initially i had no problem <br>
                        with the vehicle and i loved it. <br>
                        After passing 6000 kms, a noise <br>
                        is heard and service team told it <br>
                        is common across all brio. I wrote <br>
                        3 mails to HONDA, but no replies <br>
                        from them. Finally after registering <br>
                        the complaint in the website, I got a <br>
                        reply from HONDA mentioning this <br>
                        is common noise and they will inform <br>
                        it to product department.
                      <h4>Comfort & Luxury:-</h4> 
                      I bought my Honda Brio SMT model <br>
                      4 years back and I am loving it, the <br>
                      drive is so smooth and comfortable and <br>
                      It requires minimum gear shift, engine <br>
                      has no sound at all, seats are so comfortable, <br>
                      sound of the system is so good, the interiors are <br>
                      very appealing, specially I like the shape of the <br>
                      gear handle (like a golf ball).

                        How is the noise level  <br>and vibrations in WRV diesel engine?
                        <br><br>
                        Yes they are there but can be isolated by turning on the volume to higher decibel level . 

                        <h4>Comfort & Luxury:-</h4> 
                        Honda WR-V Car looks very stylish and amazing. A lot of safety and comfort features are in this car that make my driving experience amazing. Also, its interior is very classy and provides superb comfort. I bought a Honda WRV a few months ago and I am very happy with the performance of this car. Acceleration is good that I can feel the power.
